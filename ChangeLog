   specify custom filter right on the command line. Thanks again
   go to Martynas Bieliauskas
 * implemented aggregation
 * Somewhat cleared the display and made it (hopefully) more
   readable
 * implemented rx/tx recognition
 * I forget to mention Rodrigo Reyes to come up with idea of
   aggregation.

2002-10-16	Jakub Skopal	<j@kubs.cz>

 * implemented suspend feature, thanks go to Rodrigo Reyes for

 * implemented reading of ~/.jnettop configuration file
 * added example .jnettop file
 * the idea of filters came from Martynas Bieliauskas whom I owe
   many thanks

 * main() now returns 0 when the program was legaly terminated
 * fixed build for systems which don't have gethostbyaddr_r()
 * changes in jnettop.c to use select() and avoid 100% processor time
   consumption on systems, which support it (Linux)

2002-08-31	Jakub Skopal	<j@kubs.cz>

 * modified configure.ac, so that it uses -Wall when compiling with GCC.
   Thanks again go to David B Harris aka ElectricElf
 * corrected too-wide terminal bug. Many thanks to David B Harris aka

   should be opened for listening
 * added "-d"/"--debug" parameter for DUMPing debug messages
 * added separate in/out accounting
