This is jnettop 0.4.
It's a package, which should do simmilar job for network as top does for
processes.

-- Introduction --

After administering various networks I decided to write this piece of code,
becouse I didn't find anything that was simmilar or suitable for my purpose.
I often needed to watch traffic on the outbound router by the times our line
was getting red and see, what's going on there and whether is it right.
I hope, somebody out there will find this tool usefull too.
Just in case you wanted to write me any comments, hints, postcards, herritage
announcements, love, wish, abuse etc., feel free to use my email, j@kubs.cz.

-- libpcap dependency explanation --

  (Why cannot I switch interfaces while running jnettop. I've seen this
   feature on a screenshot)

There are various libpcap versions out there with different capabilities.
Notably there is 0.6.2 and older, which don't support interface discovery.
With these versions of libpcap, you won't be able to switch between interfaces
while running jnettop. Anyway, you can use "-i" parameter to specify which
interface to listen on (since jnettop 0.2).
With libpcap version 0.7 and younger, you will be able to switch between
various interfaces while running jnettop.
NOTE, that the RPM distributed on http://www.kubs.cz is compiled for default
RedHat 7.3 environment, which contains older abovementioned version of libpcap
and thus doesn't support interface switching.

If you want to get newer version of libpcap, go to http://www.tcpdump.org to
get sources or you can find newer versions in RPMs on http://rpmfind.net

-- glib2 dependency --

  (Won't there be port for glib < 2 versions?)

No. This package is heavily dependant on thread functions contained in glib2.
I believe, that there are (will be) various platforms for which glib2 is ported
and thus prefer to depend on generic threading capabilities of glib2 to meet
less portability problems later.
Glib2 is now available in RPMs for RedHat (and simmilar), DEBs for Debian and
.tar.gz for the others.

-- UNKNOWN traffic --

  (Jnettop displays a lot of UNKNOWN traffic and UNK. protocol)

Jnettop was done as basic analysis tool and does not interpret most of the
protocols on Internet. Namely it can only interpret TCP/UDP/IP on EtherNet
or Linux "any" device. This is sufficient for vast majority of linux users
(=me .-)). In case you want me to add support for another encapsulation
(802.11, etc...), please send me output of jnettop -d and a piece of tcpdump
dumpfile with examples of packets. I'll do my best :)
In case you want me to add support for another higher-level protocol
(IPX, AppleTalk,...), please, send me a vote for that protocol. Jnettop was
designed for IPv4 packets and would require major rewrite to support other
protocols.

-- PORTABILITY --

  (Does Jnettop work under system X on computer Y)

For portability description, please, see PORTING file. There is an up-to-date
status of portability issues. Generally, I'd like jnettop to be working on
any system, which has glib2, pcap and ncurses ports.

-- content filtering --

  (What the hell is that?)

Jnettop attempts to "understand" what communication is in the TCP/UDP data and
displays this information along the stream. For example it can recover URL from
a HTTP request or addresses of ongoing SMTP session. Content filtering is
enabled by default and can be disabled while running. There can be performance
problems on a very busy server which would cause various packets to be dropped.
