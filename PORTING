This file reflects status of porting to various OSes/architectures/etc...
In case you succeeded in compiling and/or running jnettop on a new platform,
please send me a report, patch, problem report, etc... to j@kubs.cz

thanks, Jakub

Many thanks to sourceforge for their compile farm. I was able to do many
portability tests in there.

NetBSD/1.6.1	NetBSD		i386	0.10.1		COMPILABLE

Notes:

(1) --disable-multithreaded-resolver option is necessary for configure.

Explanation:

NOT WORKING     I had problems compiling the package and/or the prerequisities
                which I wasn't able to correct myself.
COMPILABLE      Package can be built, but I didn't have root access to test,
                whether it actually works.
RUNNING         Package can be compiled and it worked.
