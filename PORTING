This file reflects status of porting to various OSes/architectures/etc...
In case you succeeded in compiling and/or running jnettop on a new platform,
please send me a report, patch, problem report, etc... to j@kubs.cz

thanks, Jakub Skopal

Many thanks to sourceforge for their compile farm. I was able to do many
portability tests in there.

OS		Distro		Architecture		Status
---------------	---------------	-----------------------	-----------------
Linux/2.4	RedHat 7.3	i386			RUNNING
Linux/2.4	Debian 2.2	i386			COMPILABLE
FreeBSD/4.6	FreeBSD		i386			COMPILABLE
Linux/2.4	Debian 3.0	Alpha			COMPILABLE
MacOS X 10.1 SE	MacOS X		PPC			NOT WORKING (1)
Linux/2.4	Debian 3.0	PPC			COMPILABLE
Linux/2.4	Debian 3.0	Sparc			COMPILABLE
Solaris 8	Solaris 8	Sparc			COMPILABLE

Notes:

(1) I was not able to compile gettext on MacOS X 10.1 due to a CC internal
    error (gettext is glib2 requirement)

Explanation:

NOT WORKING     I had problems compiling the package and/or the prerequisities
                which I wasn't able to correct myself.
COMPILABLE      Package can be built, but I didn't have root access to test,
                whether it actually works.
RUNNING         Package can be compiled and it worked.
