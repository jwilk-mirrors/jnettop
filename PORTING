This file reflects status of porting to various OSes/architectures/etc...
In case you succeeded in compiling and/or running jnettop on a new platform,
please send me a report, patch, problem report, etc... to j@kubs.cz

thanks, Jakub

Many thanks to sourceforge for their compile farm. I was able to do many
portability tests in there.

OS		Distro		Arch.	Ver.tested	Status
---------------	---------------	-------	--------------- ----------------
Linux/2.4	Fedora Core 1	i386	0.10.1		RUNNING
Solaris 5.9	Solaris 5.9	i386	0.10.1		COMPILABLE
Linux/2.4	Debian 2.2	i386	0.10.1		COMPILABLE
Linux/2.4	RedHat 9	i386	0.10.1		COMPILABLE
FreeBSD/4.8	FreeBSD		i386	0.10.1		COMPILABLE

Notes:

(1) I was not able to compile gettext on MacOS X 10.1 due to a CC internal
    error (gettext is glib2 requirement)
(2) Latest gcc version is required or it is necessary to disable
    optimalizations. I had problems with gcc 2.95.2.

Explanation:

NOT WORKING     I had problems compiling the package and/or the prerequisities
                which I wasn't able to correct myself.
COMPILABLE      Package can be built, but I didn't have root access to test,
                whether it actually works.
RUNNING         Package can be compiled and it worked.
